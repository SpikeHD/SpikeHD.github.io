  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  <p>
    If you are here, I either sent this to you, or you came across it on my <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD">GitHub profile</a>. <br><br>
    So, welcome! My name is Jaden, I am a web and software developer based in Canada, and I am currently attending my local college in pursuit of
    a Computer Information Systems degree!
  </p>
  <h1>How to navigate</h1>
  <p>
    If you couldn't tell, this site is designed to try and replicate a Windows XP desktop environment. I was inspired
    to do this because my very first computer ran Windows XP! Each desktop icon is a project that I have worked on, and
    you can click on them to open windows that contain information about them!
  </p>
  <h1>Settings</h1>
  <p>
    If you didn't like the introduction, or would like to change some other settings, just click the "Settings" desktop icon!
  </p>
  <h1>Thanks for coming!</h1>
  <p>
    Whether you're here for 5 seconds just to check it out, or 5 minutes to check out my projects, I appreciate it all the same :) <br><br>
    There is also some hidden secrets if you feel like looking for them! <br><br>
