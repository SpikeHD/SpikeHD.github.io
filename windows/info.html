  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
  <p>
    If you are here, I probably either sent this to you, or you came across it on my <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD">GitHub profile</a>.
    <br><br>

    In any case, hi! I am SpikeHD, I am a software developer from Canada!
  </p>
  <h1>How to navigate</h1>
  <p>
    This site is designed to replicate a Windows XP desktop, each project is a desktop icon that will open a seperate, stylized window explaining it!
  </p>
  <h1>My favorites</h1>
  <p>
    Overwhelmed? That's fair, honestly. In that case, I reccommend checking out "Contributions", "asciivert.art", "CSMLC", or "GM Studio 2 Extensions"!
  </p>
  <h1>Thanks for coming!</h1>
  <p>
    Whether you're here for 5 seconds just to see what it's all about, or 5 minutes because you're interested in the details of some project, I appreciate it all the same :)
    <br><br>
    There is also some hidden secrets if you feel like looking for them!
