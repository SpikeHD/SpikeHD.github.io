      AmazonMonitor is a simple project: it monitors Amazon item stock and prices. It was built in Javascript using
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">cheerio</a>.
      It takes input and display output all through the Discord API!

      Creating a price monitor for a large website presents some challenges. They, of course, do not really want people scraping their site, and suggest using their
      <a target="_blank" href="https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/">Products API</a> instead. An y'know what, that is <i>totally fair</i>.
      This project wasn't really meant for any widespread attention or usage anyways. Rather, I wanted to experiment with getting around barriers that popular sites,
      such as Amazon, impose to prevent this sort of thing. "Nothing is unhackable" and all that, not that any of this is hacking in any capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this project, I have actually made a <i>bunch</i> of price monitors for various websites. They are all private as they were commissions, but apparently
      there is a market for that kinda thing. Who knew!

    <h1>Technical Stuff (ew gross yunky crunky)</h1>
    <p>
      The program flow works like this:
      <ul>
        <li>Use <pre>puppeteer</pre> to grab the contents of a product page</li>
        <li>Scour the contents of the page (which is just raw HTML) with <pre>cheerio</pre> for all our relevant information</li>
        <li>Organize all of that data into a nice JavaScript object, which is used and passed around wherever it needs to be</li>
      </ul>
      Because of the Discord API aspect being almost entirely decoupled from the scraper aspect, this could very easily
      be repurposed into some other medium. I just haven't done it yet :P
    </p>
    <h2>Preventing Being Flagged</h2>
    <p>
      The most overwhelmingly prevalent concern when creating a project like this is <b>getting flagged</b> <i>(gasp!)</i>. Thankfully, "getting flagged" in this case
      just means your IP being told to shut the **** up and stop pestering Amazon for a little while. When this happens, pages will start redirecting you
      to a Captcha page instead. Not much of a way around that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to prevent this, a few tactics are employed:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Using <pre>puppeteer</pre>.</b> This is a headless browser, which looks very much like a real one to most websites. Combined with some launch settings
          and user-agent stuff, you can look pretty convincing to an unsuspecting site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Proxying.</b> Optionally, a list of proxies can be provided, in which each request made by the headless browser will use a random one, making
          you <i>very hard</i> to track down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Being nice.</b> Amazon doesn't want you doing this, which I get, so AmazonMonitor cuts them a bit of slack and defaults to making requests every few minutes, rather
          than seconds.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Other Features</h2>
    <p>
      AmazonMonitor can also view search queries. You pass a query, such as "iphone" or "bath bomb", and the results of that query will be scraped and cached.
      Then, during the monitors periodic check, it will run that search query again, and compare the current results to it's cache. Anything that has gone down
      will be pushed as a notification, just like a regular item!
