    Dorion
  </div>
  <p>
    Dorion was a project I created to leverage the pre-installation of <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/web-view">WebView2</a>
    on Windows 11 and updated Windows 10 machines to create a smaller Discord binary. The project also supports themes and plugins!

    The original intention was to simply display the Discord web app using <a target="_blank" href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, a desktop application framework that
    is designed to allow creating web-based frontends and applications with Rust backends. Using Tauri, I was able to create a binary that was only ~7mb! (That is much better than the ~70mb of the Discord client)
  </p>
  <p>
    Quickly though, the scope of Dorion evolved. I learned that <a target="_blank" href="https://betterdiscord.app/themes">BetterDiscord themes</a> were also applicable to
    the web version of Discord, and thus, would work with Dorion. That got me thinking...

  <div class="dorion_img">

    Dorion with a theme applied!
  </div>
  <p>
    So now, Dorion is a cross-platform project that supports themes, <i>including BetterDiscord themes</i>, and plugins (NOT including BetterDiscord plugins)! Because of the
    added complexity, I was also able to learn more Rust, which is becoming one of my favorite languages, as well as Javascript/CSS injection, which was really fun to learn!
