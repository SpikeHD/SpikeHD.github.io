    Dorion
  </div>
  <p>
    Dorion was a project I created to leverage the pre-installation of <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/controls/web-view">WebView2</a>
    on Windows 11 and updated Windows 10 machines to create a smaller Discord binary. The backend is written in Rust and the "frontend" (which is basically
    just a settings menu and splash screen) is written in pure HTML/CSS/JS. The project also supports themes and plugins!

    The original intention was to simply display the Discord web app using <a target="_blank" href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, a desktop application framework that
    is designed to allow creating web-based frontends and applications with Rust backends. Using Tauri, I was able to create a binary that was only ~7mb! (That is 
    much better than the ~70mb of the Discord client)
  </p>
  <p>
    Quickly though, the scope of Dorion evolved. I learned that <a target="_blank" href="https://betterdiscord.app/themes">BetterDiscord themes</a> were also applicable to
    the web version of Discord, and thus, would work with Dorion. That got me thinking...
  </p>
  <div class="dorion_img">
    <img src="./image/screenshots/dorion/dorion_1.jpg" />
    Dorion with a theme applied!
  </div>
  <div>
    ... I needed to overcomplicate yet another project. So I did! In the Rust backend, I wrote functions that inject CSS and JavaScript, which was actually relatively easy.
    I then had to create a CSS preparser, as themes that used CSS <pre>url()</pre>s would fail due to CORS on the Discord site. This preparser would find all <pre>url()</pre>-based imports
    within the CSS, which includes other CSS files (which are just appended to the main CSS string that is injected), as well as images (which are downloaded and
    inserted as raw Base64).
  </div>
  <p>
    Before v0.4.0, this would create a small startup delay. Recently though, I rewrote part of Dorion to load <i>as the regular client loads, asynchronously</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So with all that having been done, Dorion is now a cross-platform project that supports themes, <i>including BetterDiscord themes</i>, and plugins (NOT including BetterDiscord plugins)! Because of the
    added complexity, I was also able to learn more Rust, which is becoming one of my favorite languages, as well as Javascript/CSS injection, which was really fun to learn!
