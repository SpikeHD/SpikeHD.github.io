  <h1>Other Open-Source Contributions</h1>

  <p>
    Over the years, I've tried to contribute where I can to projects that I like or find interesting. I think I've gained very valuable knowledge from contributing
    to other projects, mostly because I get valuable feedback on what I put in from people who typically know much more than me, but also because it plunges me into
    large codebases that I learn from just by working within them!
    <br><br>
    Here's a list of some of the projects I've contributed to:

      <h2>Grasscutter</h2>
      <span class="oss_subtitle">
        A server emulator for Genshin Impact
      </span>

      <p>
        I think this was one of my first open source contributions actually. There is a personal story behind some of this, but the high level gist
        is that I thought the idea was cool, so I dove in and wrote some of the server's
        <a href="https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/20" target="_blank">first</a>-<a href="https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/22" target="_blank">ever</a> commands!
        Through this and other contributions (below), I ended up being part of the Grasscutter team for a while.
        <br><br>
        It is also the first (and last, as of writing) time I've used Java in a non-educational setting. Here's hoping it stays that way ðŸ¤¢
        <br><br>
        (I also wrote the <a href="https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter/pull/102" target="_blank">GitHub build action</a> for this project)

      <h2>Cultivation</h2>
      <span class="oss_subtitle">
        A Grasscutter Launcher
      </span>

      <p>
        Cultivation is a launcher for the aforementioned Grasscutter server emulator. It handled automated server (for local hosting) and client downloads, mod management,
        game patching, and more! It was created using <a href="https://tauri.app" target="_blank">Tauri</a>, which is a Rust-based library for creating desktop apps
        using system-integrated webviews.
        <br><br>
        I wrote a most of this application (<a href="https://github.com/Grasscutters/Cultivation/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">check out that graph!</a>) with the help of a couple others,
        though I no longer work on it.
        <br><br>
        The backend of the app is written in Rust, and the frontend is written in React + Typescript.

      <h2>Vita3K</h2>
      <span class="oss_subtitle">
        A Playstation Vita emulator
      </span>

      <p>
        I never owned a Vita when I was younger, but I do love it's game library. I also own a handheld that is <a href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-mini" target="_blank">suspiciously Vita-shaped</a>,
        which I use this emulator a lot on.
        <br><br>
        While I'm inexperienced with emulation (and am super interested in learning more about), I wanted to use 60 FPS patches <i>in one specific game <b>so bad</b></i> that I ended up taking a crack at
        implementing an entire <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K/pull/3419" target="_blank">binary patching system</a>, similar to one found in <a href="https://github.com/Electry/VitaGrafix" target="_blank">VitaGrafix</a>,
        a tool from the original Vita homebrew scene. 
        <br><br>
        I also have <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K/pull/3479" target="_blank">another pending PR (at time of writing)</a> that improves on this system alot.
        Maybe one day I'll even fix some of the crashes that I encounter frequently...

      <h2>Tauri/Wry</h2>
      <span class="oss_subtitle">
        Rust libraries for creating native applications
      </span>

      <p>
        As an avid Tauri user for the <a href="https://spikehd.github.io/projects/dorion" target="_blank">Dorion</a> project, I've had to contribute to Tauri a few times, specifically regarding
        <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/11056" target="_blank">extension support</a>.
        The <code>tauri</code> PRs were all pretty low-friction and the people who work on it are very nice, but since it uses <code>wry</code> under the hood, I needed to coordinate
        my PRs between several repos!

      <h2>WebUI (<code>rust-webui</code>)</h2>
      <span class="oss_subtitle">
        A C library for using webviews to create native applications
      </span>

      <p>
       WebUI aims to allow users to create native applications using installed browsers (note: this is different from webviews). It is written in C, but provides bindings for MANY other languages,
       such as Go, Zig, and Deno. What it lacked at the time, however, was a proper Rust library, <a href="https://github.com/webui-dev/rust-webui/pull/3" target="_blank">so I wrote one!</a>
       <br><br>
       This PR was pretty large, and it involved <code>bindgen</code>, lots of organization, GitHub Actions, and <i>so much</i> documentation. I'm happy with how it turned out,
       but I didn't have time to keep maintaining it, and nobody else has stepped up, so it's sat pretty dormant since then. Womp womp.
