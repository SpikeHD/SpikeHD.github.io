    CSMLC is a project I created to learn image recognition machine learning. Using a modified <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/cs2-data-dumper">CS2 ESP program</a>
    to dump bounding box data into YOLO format, I am able to efficiently gather training data after just a little bit of cleanup!

    It uses <a href="https://ultralytics.com/">Ultralytics (YOLOv8)</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">OpenCV-Python</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dxcam/">dxcam</a>, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyDirectInput/">pydirectinput</a>
  </p>

  <h1>Example</h1>
  <p>
    Top-left is the output, where it will show the bounding boxes of players.

  <h1>Technical Stuff</h1>
  <p>
    The training is done using YOLOv8, which is a super fast and super accurate machine learning model. To get training data, I forked an existing
    <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/cs2-data-dumper">CS2 ESP</a> cheat, and added a feature to dump bounding box data into YOLO format. This way, I can easily gather training data without having to
    manually label each bounding box. Of course, I have to go through and remove bounding boxes that label players through walls, but that is way easier than manually
    entering the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is trained on my RTX 3070 8gb, and took about 1 hour to train to the level shown above! The original training set was about 1.6k images,
    which isn't really alot in machine learning standards, but I plan on adding more images in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    The automatic controls, such as automatically pressing the trigger when moused over an enemy, or snapping the aim to enemies automatically, are done with
    pyautogui. While the trigger-pressing is very effective and easy CS2 (and likely most games) are a bit finnicky when sending direct mouse movement inputs, 
    so it's a bit janky. When using it as more of an aim "assist" rather than an aimbot, it works pretty well.

    The repo contains, and will be updated with, the best model that I train at any given time. You can clone the repo and try it yourself
