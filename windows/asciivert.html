    AsciiVert was a tool I created that could convert images AND videos into ascii art! It is a fairly old project now, but I am still proud of it.
    It is written in JS and utilizes <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp">Jimp</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">canvas</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg">fluent-ffmpeg</a> 
    and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phaux/node-ffmpeg-stream">ffmpeg-stream</a>.

      AsciiVert works best on lineart and images with bold, constrasting colors/shapes/etc.<br/>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Like most of my projects, the original scope was somewhat small: make a tool that converts images to ascii art. And again, like most of my projects,
    the scope immediately expanded as I learned of what I could do if I utilized <a target="_blank" href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg.</a>
    The nice thing about ffmpeg is that I didn't have to manually write a myriad of different handlers for different video/image filetypes,
    so the project stayed small but extremely versatile.
  </p>
  <div class="ascii_image_section">
    <div class="comparison">
      <img src="./image/screenshots/asciivert/asciivert_2.jpg" />

    </div>
    Some images work better than others...
  </div>
  <p>
    AsciiVert has MANY options for tweaking the image or video, such as setting the framerate and symbol-resolution (for example, 200x200 is 200 characters by 200 characters,
    rather than by pixels).
  </p>
  <p>
    AsciiVert also has (had) a website and API! I stopped paying for the domain ages ago, but the site came with 3 options: image, raw text, and video. Image and video
    are fairly self-explanatory, but the raw text, or "mini" mode, was intended for creating very small, copy-pasteable versions of images, to send as messages or in emails
    or whatever.
  </p>

    <img src="./image/screenshots/asciivert/asciivert_site.jpg" style="width: 90%" />
    AsciiVert.art with the "Convert a video" menu section selected
  </div>
  <p>
    The images can also come out quite large! <a target="_blank" href="./image/screenshots/asciivert/asciivert_4.png">Click here</a> (opens in a new tab)
    to see a high-resolution image generated with the tool. You can zoom in and see all of the characters in perfect detail! The one linked, for example, is almost
    1MB with a resolution of 3976x4970

    A fun question I had to answer early on was "how do you calculate the 'darkness' of a pixel?". Googling that now, you will probably just find
    a StackOverflow answer, but when I was, I couldn't find much for some reason. I ended up using this forumala<br/>

    <pre class="code">
    const brightness = Math.sqrt(
      (.241 * color.r * color.r) +
      (.691 * color.g * color.g) +
      (.068 * color.b * color.b)
    )
    </pre>
    that I found in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nbdtech.com/Blog/archive/2008/04/27/calculating-the-perceived-brightness-of-a-color.aspx">an old blog post from 2008</a>.
    Then, I have an array of symbols that are sorted from most dense to least dense (to simulate "darkness"), and I use the brightness to grab one:
    <pre class="code">
    const symbols = ['@', '#', '$', '%', ';', ':', '^', '*', ',', '.', '\'', ' ']
    const symbol = symbols[Math.round(brightness / (255 / (symbols.length-1)))]
    </pre>
    This list has some potentially redundant characters (',' and '.' are <i>very</i> similar), so something I often do is change the amount of symbols/which symbols to use depending on the
    color/brightness range of my image, to produce more usable results. That would have made a great CLI/API options, but I did not think of it at the time ðŸ˜„.

      A spinning tomato. Very cool. View the full un-scaled (4200x2366) version <a target="_blank" href="./image/screenshots/asciivert/tomato_large.mp4">here!</a>
      (it may say the file is corrupt because it is too large, so you'll have to download the file)
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Video processing works basically the same as image processing, where the image will be split into frames, each frame will be processed, and then the frames will
    be shoved back together as a video. Video audio is preserved as well!
