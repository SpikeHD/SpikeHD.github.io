        and was essentially completed in a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/SpikeHD.github.io/commit/399dfd304b7c4aa170b526b00bf1c17f1d03c84a">single day!</a>

        It was built using traditional JavaScript, no frameworks, plugins, or tools. Although I do have plenty of experience in React/Preact, it was nice
        creating something without any extra complexity.

        <li>Windows XP was the very first computer operating system I experienced! If I told you how young I was when I used it, you may start to feel old.</li>
        <li>This site (mostly) works on mobile devices!</li>
