    <p>NDS_Pong is a very simple project:</p>
    <p>It is pong, for the Nintendo DS!</p>

    <br>

    <p>
      The project is written in C++, using the <a href="https://libnds.devkitpro.org/">LibNDS devkitPro library.</a>
      It only took a few hours to create the base, and it supports local multiplayer!
    </p>

    <p>Above is an early iteration of the game. Score wasn't even calculated, nor displayed</p>

    <p>
      I created this simply to learn something weird. The Nintendo DS was a big part of my childhood,
      so I though it made a good fit for a quick small project!

    <p>The menu at the bottom is controlled by the touchscreen!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">[ I will be attaching an image/video of the game running on physical hardware when I mod my DSi!! ]</p>
