      Sloth is a performance profiling Node.js library written in TypeScript. It was created during my time at <a href="https://www.acromedia.com/">AcroMedia</a>.

      A simple example of using the Profiler.
    </div>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <div>
      Sloth has three main components:
      <ul>
        <li><pre>Profiler</pre></li>
        <li><pre>bench()</pre></li>
        <li><pre>benchFile()</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Profiler</h2>
    <div>
      The Profiler class is the backbone of Sloth. It can be used just by itself, by creating an instance, and then calling the <pre>start()</pre>
      and <pre>end()</pre> methods. It utilizes <pre>child_process</pre>, which creates a "watcher" process, in order to properly keep track of process usage
      independant of what script it was called within! This prevents muddying results with the Profilers memory footprint.<br><br>

      <pre>Profiler.end()</pre> returns an instance of <pre>ProfilerResults</pre>, which is used for getting memory usage, averages, and creating graphs and snapshots
    </div>
    <h2>bench()</h2>
    <div>
      The bench function takes in a function, shoves it into an isolated <pre>child_process</pre>, creates a <pre>Profiler</pre> that watches that PID,
      runs ths functions, and finally returns the results of <pre>Profiler.end()</pre>.
    </div>
    <div class="sloth_image_section flex-center-col">
      <img src="./image/screenshots/sloth/sloth_2.png" />
      Using the bench() function. You can even pass values to the function arguments!
    </div>
    <div>
      So how does it work? Node.js doesn't exactly just <i>let</i> pass a function into a seperate process, so I had to get <i>super</i> creative.
      <br><br>
      Basically, Sloth takes the function as a parameter, converts it to a string (in JavaScript, you can just do <pre>String(myFunction)</pre>!), does
      does some string manipulation (expanded on below), and passes that function string to the child process! That child process, after recieving the 
      function string, converts it BACK to an actual function (<pre>Function(myFunctionString)</pre>, JS is weeeeird), and then runs it.
    </div>
    <h3>Function String Manipulation</h3>
    <div>
      To handle running the function in its own process, the functions content/body is extracted and sent to the child process. It was a pain in the ass.
    </div>
    <pre class="code">
/* This function declaration is stripped away, including the { } */
function myFn() {
  /* ...BUT the inner body of the function will remain! */
  console.log("Test")
}

/* Therefore, the string passed to the child process will just be: */
console.log("Test")
    </pre>
    <div>
      A <pre>Profiler()</pre> is then created to track the spawned child process. The child process is then sent a signal to start the function, which it does.
      Once the function is finished, the child process sends a "finished" message back, and the profiler is stopped and the results are returned!
    </div>
    <h2>benchFile()</h2>
    <div>
      The <pre>benchFile()</pre> function is essentially identical to the <pre>bench()</pre> function, except a filename must be passed instead of a JavaScript function.
      Principally, they work the exact same.
