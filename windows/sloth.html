      Sloth is a performance profiling Node.js library written in TypeScript. It was created during my time at <a href="https://www.acromedia.com/">AcroMedia</a>.

      A simple example of using the Profiler.

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>
      Sloth has three main components:
      <ul>
        <li><pre>Profiler</pre></li>
        <li><pre>bench()</pre></li>
        <li><pre>benchFile()</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Profiler</h2>
    <p>
      The <pre>Profiler</pre> class is the backbone of Sloth. It can be used just by itself, by creating an instance, and then calling the <pre>start()</pre>
      and <pre>end()</pre> methods. It utilizes <pre>child_process</pre>, which creates a "watcher" process, in order to properly keep track of process usage
      independant of what script it was called within! This prevents muddying results with the Profilers memory footprint.<br/>

      <pre>Profiler.end()</pre> returns an instance of <pre>ProfilerResults</pre>, which is used for getting memory usage, averages, and creating graphs and snapshots
    </p>
    <h2>bench()</h2>
    <p>
      The bench function takes in a function, shoves it into an isolated <pre>child_process</pre>, creates a <pre>Profiler</pre> that watches that PID,
      runs ths functions, and finally returns the results of <pre>Profiler.end()</pre>.
    </p>
    <div class="sloth_image_section flex-center-col">
      <img src="./image/screenshots/sloth/sloth_2.png" />
      Using the bench() function. You can even pass values to the function arguments!
