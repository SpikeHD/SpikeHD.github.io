    GameMaker Studio 2 Extensions

  <div id="gm_content">
    <p>
      So, full transparency, I <i>don't</i> use GameMaker. Like, ever. At all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do, however, have a good friend who uses it, and they use it <i>a lot</i>. From what I have learned from this friend, it seems
      GMS2 is pretty good, but doesn't come with quite everything one would want. For example, my friend needed to be able to read file metadata
      for their save files (specifically, the modification date, so they could see what is the most recent save). This led me to create...
    </p>

    <h1>GM File Metadata</h1>
    <p>
      This extension is pretty self explanatory; it exposes functions that allow you to read file metadata. It's pretty simple, sure, but this is somewhat
      rudimentary functionality that should be fairly helpful to some.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't just want to write it in the language most people do (C++). Oh no no no, I needed to make things complicated for myself.
      After some experimentation I found that I could write the extension in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and pretty
      easily too! At this point the extension was a pretty simple task, writing super simple functions that were no more than a few lines
      that took in file paths and spat out metadata. That hard(er) part was making sure the extension would work right.
    </p>

    <h2>Why, GameMaker, why?</h2>
    <p>
      See, GameMaker function parameters AND return types (with a big exception that I'll get to in a second) can be one of two types: string, or double.
      That's it. No booleans, no integers, no nothing. For this project, it was no big deal, since I was just dealing with string paths
      and returning timestamps (converted to doubles), but I found this limitation to be... interesting.
    </p>
    <div>
      The big exception earlier is that you can actually take in... "anything". When you pass, say, a string into a function, your
      extension will actually be passed a <pre>char *</pre>. This means that GameMaker is <i>really</i> just passing you a pointer
      to whatever is being passed in. For example, you can use GMLs <a target="_blank" href="https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Buffers/Buffers.htm">buffer functions</a>
      to create and pass in buffers, and then read that buffer in your extension. In theory, assuming you understand the internal memory structure of GameMakers
      arrays, or structs, etc., you could even read those in your extension. Though, they
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMakerStudio_ExtensionExample/blob/781bb1464be7399d0d9cd4353775238a95087d21/ExampleExtension.cpp#L102C27-L102C27">
        recommend you be careful (as GML controls the variables life on its own).
      </a>

    <p>
      I have not tried this myself, and I... don't think I want to.
    </p>

    <h1>GM Sysinfo</h1>
    <p>
      The next project I wanted to create had a slightly larger scope. I want to be able to get <i>as much</i> system information as possible,
      and expose that to GameMaker. This includes things like CPU name and usage, memory size and usage, GPU info, etc. I also wanted to be able to get
      information about the current context, like the games PID, user's username, and PCs hostname.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, getting and returning this information was pretty simple, with the help of the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.rs/sysinfo/latest/sysinfo/">sysinfo</a>
      crate. Names were strings and values (clockspeed, memory) were doubles, no problem. Just about everything I needed was there, except for GPU information...
    </p>

    <h2>Apparently GPU information is hard to get</h2>
    <p>
      So, a cool fun fact I got to learn (as someone who has never done any GPU-level programming thus far), is that GPU information is
      <i>really</i> hard to get without help. To tackle this, I came up with... well... technically two solutions.
    </p>
    <div>
      The first solution was for MacOS. The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/">gfx-rs</a> team has
      created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs">Metal bindings</a> for Rust, and I was able to use that to
      grab the two pieces of GPU info that I felt were reasonable to obtain, VRAM and GPU name. The choice for this was:

      <ul>
        <li>Unlike just about anything Apple related, it was super simple</li>
        <li>It makes the built .dylib super small</li>
      </ul>

      For the other two platforms, Windows and Linux, I obviously had to come up with a different solution.
    </div>
    <p>
      You are welcome to call me lazy for this, because I agree, but the decision I ended up making was to use the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano">Vulkano</a> crate. This crate is a wrapper around the Vulkan API, and
      comes with both benefits and caveats. The benefits are that its pretty easy to use, and its cross platform. It exposes the two
      aforementioned pieces of information I wanted (VRAM and GPU name) with a relatively low amount of fanfare. The problem, however,
      is that it doesn't support <i>all</i> GPUs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the grand scheme of things, Vulkan is a relatively new API (yknow, compared to OpenGL). Realistically I don't see this as much
      of a problem as, for example, the oldest NVIDIA GPU that supports Vulkan is the GT 630, which came out in 2012. It doesn't significantly
      increase the build size either (in fact, the Windows build is smaller than the MacOS build!), so I think its a fair tradeoff.
    </p>

    <h1>So how does using them look?</h1>
    <p>
      Good question! The function calls look identical to regular GML function calls. Here is an example from GM Sysinfo:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
    var gpu = sysinfo_get_gpu_name();
      
    if (string_pos("RTX", gpu) == 0) {
      show_message_async("Sorry, but your GPU sucks :/");
      exit;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
      Easy peasy! Just like you would use anything else!
    </p>
