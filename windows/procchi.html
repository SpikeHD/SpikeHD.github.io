  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Procchi is a dead-simple, web-accessible resource monitor, designed for servers.
    Originally, the reason I wanted to create this was to keep an eye on a VPS I use
    to host a couple Minecraft servers for friends.
  </p>

  <h1>How does it work?</h1>
  <p>
    The Procchi backend is written in pure Rust, and the frontend is written using
    a library named Preact. I opted for Preact due to how relatively lightweight it
    is, while still having the exact same functionality as regular React.
  </p>

  <h2>The Backend</h2>
  <p>
    The powerhouse of the backend is a library called <a href="https://docs.rs/sysinfo/latest/sysinfo/">sysinfo</a>.
    It is a fantastic and simple library that works on basically all platforms that would matter.
    Using this library, we can get system info (who knew!) such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk
    space, a list of running processes, and more! The information gathered is then entirely configurable and stored in-memory, 
    and the whole program does not write <i>anything</i> to disk.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to serve the web interface, and the API the web interface pings, we also
    utilize a library called <a href="https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/">tide</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>The Frontend</h2>
  <p>
    The frontend is written in TypeScript, and uses Preact. It's a pretty simple
    frontend, and only uses a couple external libraries (for the graphs, of course).
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of what the frontend shows, the image above is the main stuff you'd want to
    see, and below that contains a list of processes and their memory/CPU usage.
  </p>

  <h2>Combining Them Together</h2>
  <p>
    To make Procchi as portable as possible, the frontend files aren't fetched from an external resource,
    nor does it just come with the web files in a zip. Instead, the frontend files are compiled <i>directly into</i>
    the executable. The code for this is honestly pretty simple:
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
    // This is how we include the entire dir full of built Preact files
    static FRONTEND_DIR: Dir = include_dir!("../frontend/dist");

    // ...

    // And this is the function that reads those files to create the paths
    // required for Tide to serve them
    fn recursive_serve(app: &mut tide::Server<State>, path: Option<&Path>) {
      // For all dirs in the frontend dir (including the root), serve the files within
      let path = path.unwrap_or(FRONTEND_DIR.path());
      let dir = FRONTEND_DIR.get_dir(path).unwrap_or(&FRONTEND_DIR);

      for file in dir.files() {
        let path = format!("{}", file.path().display());

        logger::print_info(format!("Serving {}", path));

        app
          .at(&path)
          .get(move |_req: tide::Request<State>| async move {
            let mut res = tide::Response::new(200);
            res.set_body(file.contents().to_vec());
            res.set_content_type(
              mime_guess::from_path(file.path())
                .first()
                .unwrap()
                .essence_str(),
            );
            Ok(res)
          });
      }

      // For all dirs in dir, recursively serve the files within
      for dir in dir.dirs() {
        recursive_serve(app, Some(dir.path()));
      }
    }
  </pre>

  <h1>Other Information</h1>
  <h2>Filesize</h2>
  <p>
    One would think that including an entire site into a binary would be cause it to get
    somewhat hefty, but that's not really the case. A compiled Windows binary - with all features and
    plugins disabled - will be about <b>5.1 MB</b>! With all plugins enabled, it's just <b>6.4 MB</b>!
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh! And speaking of plugins...
  </p>
  <h2>Plugins</h2>
  <p>
    Okay, admittedly, calling them "plugins" doesn't really make sense, since users cannot choose
    which plugins to include or not include into the binary, nor can people make their own without
    compiling the main program. The curse of being small I guess.
  </p>
  <p>
    What "plugins" really means it "extra features". These are bits of functionality that may be useful,
    but only to a subsection of users. For example, the first plugin I added was a Minecraft server plugin.
    This is able to show the current player count, and the version it's running under the "Quick Stats" area.
    Another plugin that is planned (and may already be available by the time you read this!) is a Docker plugin,
    for showing containers and their various stats.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/Procchi/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, I actually compile two
    seperate binaries for each platform. An "all-features" binary, and a "minimal" binary. The all-features
    binary is just that, it contains all plugins and features (however, they are still selectively enabled
    via the CLI when launching Procchi). The minimal binary, of course, is exactly what you think it is, it
    contains no plugins or extra features, for those who just want the base functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    For plugins, the Rust "features" functionality is used, so someone compiling for themselves could also
    selectively include which plugins they want - he downside of course being that they have to build themselves.
  </p>

  <h1>Where can I find it?</h1>
  <p>
    If you'd like to give Procchi a look, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/Procchi">GitHub</a>!
    You can check any of the "build" actions for an up-to-date binary for your system.
  </p>
  <p>
    (It even features a builtin <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/Procchi#screenshots">dark mode</a>.)
