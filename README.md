## Where am I?

This site is my "portfolio" site. It contains some of my more interesting projects, as well as just some fun little extras.

## What is it made in?

Pure HTML/JS with a little bit of WASM (that I have not written, only compiled).

## Why?

Not sure, just thought it would be cool.

## Is there anything you haven't put on here?

Yep, plenty! Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD?tab=repositories">scroll through my repositories</a> in case there is something you find interesting that isn't here.
